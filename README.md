# Not Pong

This is an intro project for learning how to develop games using Godot 4.2.
It is a simple Pong clone with the added twist that the players can rotate their paddles.
There are no sounds and no persistent state between saves.
First to three wins.

Left controls:
- W: Up
- S: Down
- A: Rotate counter-clockwise
- D: Rotate clockwise

Right controls:
- Up arrow: Up
- Down arrow: Down
- Left arrow: Rotate counter-clockwise
- Right arrow: Rotate clockwise

This game was developed during the month of January 2024.
It is my first Godot project developed without following a tutorial.
